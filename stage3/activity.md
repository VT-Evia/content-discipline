# Content Creation (and Management) Activities

## Creating a Structured Collection Website

Following the **Creating a Content Model** assignment from [Stage 2](../stage2/contentstrategyactivities.md), students can create an HTML-based project to be managed in a GitHub repository and hosted as a website in GitHub Pages.

A consistent format for every entry/page on this website assignment is key to maintain the content model. This is not an assignment for individual formatting across paged or entries. We have used topics ranging from the top 10 songs on the hit parade, a collection of favorite books or movies, or a catalog of the courses a student is taking in a given term. Audience considerations will drive the content, so it is important to specify who is the intended reader of the website deliverable. We frequently ask students to build the website for the family members and friends back home.

The project includes the following:

### Planning the content model

Each page on the planned website must follow the same structure and contain one topic. For example, a website with the top 10 songs of the summer might be based on a content model like the following:

- Song title
- Performer
- Single cover image
- Personal review
- Rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Students are allowed to use generative AI tools to generate the skeleton HTML, CSS, and JS files for the project, but their prompts must not ask for sample content.

### Creating content

Once the students have the code structure for each entry on their project, they need to conduct research for the actual content. Then, they will need to use the HTML template files to create consistent entries with effective content that satisfies their users' information needs.

### Asembling the website

Students should use GitHub and Codespaces to work on their customize your website by creating a GitHub repository named in a way relevant to their siteâ€™s topic. The [resources](resources.md) page for this stage includes tutorials for GitHub and GitHub Pages that will be essential for this assignment.

    Layout and design of the website
    Accuracy and depth of content
    Creativity and originality
    Functionality and user experience.
