# Content Creation (and Management) Activities

## Creating a Structured Website

Following the **Creating a Content Model** assignment from [Stage 2](../stage2/contentstrategyactivities.md), students can create an HTML-based project to be managed in a GitHub repository and hosted as a website in GitHub Pages.

A consistent format for every entry/page on this website assignment is key to maintain the content model. This is not an assignment for individual formatting across paged or entries. We have used topics ranging from the top 10 songs on the hit parade, a collection of favorite books or movies, or a catalog of the courses a student is taking in a given term. Audience considerations will drive the content, so it is important to specify who is the intended reader of the website deliverable. We frequently ask students to build the website for the family members and friends back home.

The project includes the following:

### Planning the content model

Each page on the planned website must follow the same structure and contain one topic. For example, a website with the top 10 songs of the summer might be based on a content model like the following:

- Song title
- Performer
- Single cover image
- Personal review
- Rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Students are allowed to use generative AI tools to generate the skeleton HTML, CSS, and JS files for the project, but their prompts must not ask for sample content. Students' prompts must emphasize functionality and user experience.

### Creating content

Once the students have the code structure for each entry on their project, they need to conduct research for the actual content. Then, they will need to use the HTML template files to create consistent entries with effective content that satisfies their users' information needs.

### Asembling the website

Students should use GitHub and Codespaces to work on their customize your website by creating a GitHub repository named in a way relevant to their siteâ€™s topic. The [resources](resources.md) page for this stage includes tutorials for GitHub and GitHub Pages that will be essential for this assignment.

## Creating a Structured Collection of Topics

Depending on the scope and needs of a specific course, this assignment can be created in Markdown or DITA XML. The focus at this stage is on content creation and not necessarily the production of deliverables. Whereas the HTML-based website from the previous assignment can easily produce a user-facing website with GitHub Pages, this assignment is more about the tasks associated with topic creation for later (in [Stage 4](../stage4/overview.md)) production of deliverables.

If this assignment will be based on DITA, we recommend only using the basic DITA topic type and save the specialized technical content types of concept, task, reference, and troubleshooting for a more advanced assignment.

This assignment can have the same topic as the previous one with an intended audience of family members, friends, or peers. The content for this assignment will be based on something that the author collects or that is a fan of. It can be a collection of your PS5 games or a Harry Potter series of topics with detailed entries in which they review the books, movies, or characters.

### Creating content

Students should plan and create DITA topics (and a map) or Markdown files for entries in a collection. The assignment must require one topic or file per entry, respecting a content model in a detailed but concise tone. Images must include alt text content and, if included in DITA topics, be embeded on `<fig>` environments.

Consult the Resources page for this stage, which includes readings about Lightweight DITA (LwDITA). In LwDITA environments, a collection can include both DITA and Markdown topics.

Students should upload their collections of topics to a GitHub repository, and evaluation criteria can includer the following:

#### Structure and Organization

- Clear and logical organization of topics
- Effective use of a DITA map to link topics (if using DITA)

#### Content Clarity and Depth

- Clear and concise writing suitable for the intended audience
- Quality and quantity of content appropriate for the course
- Depth of information and appropriate level of detail

#### Technical Implementation

- Correct use of DITA or Markdown syntax
- Clean and well-organized code.
