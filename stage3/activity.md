# Content Creation (and Management) Activities

## Creating a Structured Website

Following the **Creating a Content Model** assignment from [Stage 2](../stage2/contentstrategyactivities.md), students can create an HTML-based project to be managed in a GitHub repository and hosted as a website in GitHub Pages.

A consistent format for every entry/page on this website assignment is key to maintain the content model. This is not an assignment for individual formatting across paged or entries. We have used topics ranging from the top 10 songs on the hit parade, a collection of favorite books or movies, or a catalog of the courses a student is taking in a given term. Audience considerations will drive the content, so it is important to specify who is the intended reader of the website deliverable. We frequently ask students to build the website for the family members and friends back home.

The project includes the following:

### Planning the content model

Each page on the planned website must follow the same structure and contain one topic. For example, a website with the top 10 songs of the summer might be based on a content model like the following:

- Song title
- Performer
- Single cover image
- Personal review
- Rating on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.

Students are allowed to use generative AI tools to generate the skeleton HTML, CSS, and JS files for the project, but their prompts must not ask for sample content. Students' prompts must emphasize functionality and user experience.

### Creating content

Once the students have the code structure for each entry on their project, they need to conduct research for the actual content. Then, they will need to use the HTML template files to create consistent entries with effective content that satisfies their users' information needs.

### Asembling the website

Students should use GitHub and Codespaces to work on their customize your website by creating a GitHub repository named in a way relevant to their siteâ€™s topic. The [resources](resources.md) page for this stage includes tutorials for GitHub and GitHub Pages that will be essential for this assignment.

## Creating a Structured Collection of Topics

Depending on the scope and needs of a specific course, this assignment can be created in Markdown or DITA XML. The focus at this stage is on content creation and not necessarily the production of deliverables. Whereas the HTML-based website from the previous assignment can easily produce a user-facing website with GitHub Pages, this assignment is more about the tasks associated with topic creation for later (in [Stage 4](../stage4/overview.md)) production of deliverables.

We need to create a well-structured content collection about.... well.... a collection! The audience here is people like you. The content for this assignment will be based on something that you collect or that you are a fan of. It can be a collection of your PS5 games or a Harry Potter series of topics with detailed entries in which you review the books, movies, or characters. We will work in class to pitch topics and receive feedback.
The Task:

            Content Development:
                Plan and create DITA topics (and a map) for entries in your collection.
                We need one topic per entry. Be detailed, but concise.
                Include images in <fig> environments.

            Deliverable:
                A Bootstrap-themed HTML website.
                You can ask generative AI tools for the skeleton of your topics and map and then upload to Heretto.

What to Submit?

Upload the zip file of your Bootstrap website to Canvas. I can access your DITA code in Heretto.
Assessment Criteria:

        Structure and Organization
            Clear and logical organization of topics
            Effective use of a DITA map to link topics

        Use of DITA Features
            Correct and effective use of DITA elements (e.g., <topic>, <fig>, <p>)
            Proper content reuse with conrefs as needed.

        Content Clarity and Depth
            Clear and concise writing suitable for the intended audience
            Quality and quantity of content appropriate for a 4000-level English course at Virginia Tech
            Depth of information and appropriate level of detail

        Creativity and Originality
            Creative content development for your collection
            Original approach to using DITA attributes and reuse

        Technical Implementation
            Correct use of DITA tools and syntax
            Clean and well-organized code, and proper use of Heretto to publish deliverables.
