### Videos and Websites
- [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/), a free, GitHub-based tutorial developed by Garen Torikian.
- [Learning DITA](https://learningdita.com/), a collection of DITA video and text tutorials maintained by Scriptorium.
- The YouTube playlist [“GitHub for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0lo9MOBetEFcp4SCWinBdpml9B2U25-f),” from the official GitHub account. Technical content students can skip the “Beginner Git Commands” video. The playlist has recently added videos related to GitHub Copilot that can be useful for advanced content designers.

### SIGDOC Structured Authoring Committee Resources
For this stage, we recommend several [resources developed and maintained by the S﻿IGDOC Structured Authoring Committee](https://www.acm-sigdoc-structured.org/1-curriculum-resources.html), particularly the following:

- What are DITA topics?
- Oxygen Editor Quickstart
- XMLMind Quickstart
- What is Github and how do I get started with it?
- How do I publish content using GitHub Pages?
- Modular documentation in a docs-as-code environment.

### Tools
Some colleagues in academia report that at this stage the trap of working with too many tools (including expensive enterprise-level content management systems) can be intimidating. We recommend a few software tools to get started and focus on content creation and management on a budget. Proven tools at this stage include the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). An open source code editor for editing Markdown, HTML, and XML files. Integrates with GitHub.
- [Oxygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/). An affordable XML editor with peerless (at this price point) DITA support. Its generous 30-day free trial can be enough for many introductory assignments.
- [Oxygen Web Author](https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_web_author.html). The free demo of this web-based app (with clean GitHub integration) is fully functional for DITA XML editing.
- [XMLMind](https://www.xmlmind.com/). An entry-level DITA editor with an open source personal edition. 
- [GitHub](https://github.com/). A server space for storing and managing content assets (e.g., Markdown, HTML, and XML files), a version control system, a website host (via GitHub Pages), and much more.
