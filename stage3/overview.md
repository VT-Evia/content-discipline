# Stage 3: Focus on Content Creation and Management

## Overview
This is the stage that tends to keep some colleagues in academia from incorporating activities and courses related to treating technical content as computable data and a valuable asset. For many years, this was the stage that involved a certain degree of tinkering with computer code and a combination of applications involving the command line interface and many angle brackets. In 2025, technical content can still be created through those lower level of abstraction workflows, but we are fortunate to have applications now with friendly user interfaces and all-included processes that lower the barrier for students and instructors in the humanities and liberal arts to contribute to content design, creation, and management.
