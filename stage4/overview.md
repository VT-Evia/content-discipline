# Stage 4: Deliver and Maintain

## Overview
This stage is without a doubt the most difficult for instructors and students who are primarily focusing on the disciplinary areas of content strategy and/or content design or creation. This stage is an early foray into the work of content engineers, and although it is an advanced level, we have deemed it necessary in our courses. Without it, students do not get that “Christmas morning effect” of seeing their content assets become formatted and presentable information deliverables.

## Learning Objectives
Through readings, discussions, and activities, instructors introducing students to the discipline of content and focusing on delivering and maintaining might identify the following learning objectives for students:

- epxlain the role of transformation engines like the DITA-OT and Pandoc in converting structured content assets into user-facing deliverables across multiple formats and channels
- recognize the importance of content engineering skills in technical communication workflows, especially in enabling the transition from raw content assets to fully formatted, distributable deliverables
- utilize simplified or automated publishing workflows to generate websites, PDFs, and other formats from content written in DITA XML or Markdown, without requiring advanced command-line proficiency.
- reflect on the challenges and benefits of multichannel publishing, including the “Christmas morning effect” of seeing content rendered into polished outputs for real-world audiences.
