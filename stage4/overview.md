# Stage 4: Deliver and Maintain

## Overview
This stage is without a doubt the most difficult for instructors and students who are primarily focusing on the disciplinary areas of content strategy and/or content design or creation. This stage is an early foray into the work of content engineers, and although it is an advanced level, we have deemed it necessary in our courses. Without it, students do not get that “Christmas morning effect” of seeing their content assets become formatted and presentable information deliverables.
