# Resources for Stage 4

Stage 4 is closely related to Stage 3. Therefore, most readings, tutorials, and tools included in the [Resources](../stage3/resources.md) page for Stage 3 are still relevant. The main difference is in the template repositories that use GitHub Actions for processing Markdown and DITA files to produce deliverables. These repositories allow faculty and students to use processors like Pandoc and the DITA Open Toolkit without using the local terminal or command line interface in a computer.

## Template repositories

- [DITA Open Toolkit GitHub Actions template](https://github.com/VT-Evia/dita-ot-actions)
- [Markdown/Pandoc GitHub Actions template](https://github.com/VT-Evia/pandocactions)

Please follow the instructions on each template site in combination with the [Activities](activity.md) listed for this stage.
