# Using Semantic Styles in Word Processing

## Activity Description
For this activity, you will apply guidelines for accessible design to this Unformatted Memo Report. The guidelines require use of semantic styles. In Microsoft Word, these styles can be found in the Styles ribbon and Styles Pane. Applying semantic styles not only increases the accessibility of your document but also gives your document meaning and structure. 

Ideally, every element of your document—headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and more—will be tagged with a Style that names what the element is and applies formatting. You are essentially separating content from presentation, with the presentation controlled by the styles that you have applied to different document elements.

## Needed Resources
To complete this activity, you will need to reference the following resources:
* Make Your Word Documents Accessible to People with Disabilities by Microsoft Support
* Creating Accessible Word Documents by CSUSM Instructional and Information Technology Services

And you will need to use Microsoft Word and open the Unformatted Memo Report.
