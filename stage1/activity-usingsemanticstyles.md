# Using Semantic Styles in Word Processing

## Activity Description
For this activity, you will apply guidelines for accessible design to this Unformatted Memo Report. The guidelines require use of semantic styles. In Microsoft Word, these styles can be found in the Styles ribbon and Styles Pane. Applying semantic styles not only increases the accessibility of your document but also gives your document meaning and structure. 

Ideally, every element of your document—headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and more—will be tagged with a Style that names what the element is and applies formatting. You are essentially separating content from presentation, with the presentation controlled by the styles that you have applied to different document elements.

## Needed Resources
To complete this activity, you will need to reference the following resources:
* [Make Your Word Documents Accessible to People with Disabilities](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d) by Microsoft Support
* [Creating Accessible Word Documents](https://www.csusm.edu/iits/services/accessibility/guides/word.html) by CSUSM Instructional and Information Technology Services

And you will need to use Microsoft Word and open the Unformatted Memo Report.

## Steps

1. Open the Unformatted Memo Report. Then, activate the paragraph mark symbol ![paragraph mark symbol](parasymbol.png) accessible in the Home tab in the Paragraph group.
2. Apply the built-in heading styles to each instance of Heading 1 and Heading 2. Then, modify the style specifications for the Heading 1 and Heading 2 tags (choose your own specifications).
3. Apply the built-in Normal style to all body text in the document. Then, modify the style specifications for the Normal tag (choose your own specifications). In Format > Paragraph, add space after each paragraph (there should be no paragraph markers between paragraphs or between the bulleted list and the paragraph before and after it). You will need to delete the paragraph markers (hard returns) between all paragraphs in the document.
4. Apply the built-in List Paragraph style to the bulleted list. Then, modify the style specifications for the List Paragraph tag (choose your own specifications). You will need to delete the * symbol from each list entry.
5. Insert a Caption for the figure. To do this, highlight the figure and click Insert > Caption. In the Caption window, after the figure number and colon, add a title. Click OK when done. Click anywhere in the new figure caption and go to your style ribbon--you should see a tag for Caption. Modify the style specifications for the Caption tag.
6. Add Alternative Text to the figure (describe the content of the figure in 1 or 2 sentences). To do this, highlight the figure and click Format Picture. Look for the Alt Text option.
7. Insert a Caption for the table. To do this, highlight the table and click Insert > Caption. In the Caption window, after the table number and colon, add a title. Click OK when done.
8. Identify which table row includes the column headers (this is a simple table). Open the Table Design tab and verify that "Header Row" is checked.
9. Add a meaningful hyperlink to the document. You can link to anything you want; just be sure that the linked text in the document is meaningful.
10. Insert a running header on pages 2 to 4. The running header should not appear on page 1. The header should include the document title (drawn from the Subject line of the memo) and page number.

Click the headings, body text, bulleted list, and captions to verify that all content in the document has been tagged. With the Paragraph mark symbol activated, verify that no symbols are in between paragraphs (untagged space). Verify that alternative text has been saved for the figure.
