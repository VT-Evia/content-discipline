# Analyzing Topic-Based Documentation

## Activity Goals 

This activity introduces students to the concepts of topic-based writing and information typing. Students will learn about the concepts through readings and apply their understanding through an analysis of two or more topic-based documentation sets.

A major trend in user documentation is the move to create information deliverables composed of collections of modular topics, or chunks of stand-alone content, that each focus on one thing, such as answering one question (e.g., How do I?) or explaining one concept (e.g., What is X?). In the field of technical communication, topic-based, modular content development is frequently achieved through the use of XML and, particularly, the standard known as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA).

This activity, then, is ideally paired with the activity [Identifying Content Types and Relationships](activity-identifyingcontenttypes.md). 

After completing the readings and this activity, students will develop a strong grasp of the goals of topic-based content development and approaches to typing—or classifying—content.

## Activity Description

This short activity is ideally assigned after students have read readings on information mapping and topic-based writing. It works well as an in-class activity. 

The goal is to have students apply their understanding of the concepts of “mapping,” “typing,” and “topics” to one or two sets of documentation composed of collections of modular topics that each focus on one thing, such as answering one question (e.g., How do I?) or explaining one concept (e.g., What is X?).

Ask students to examine, individually or in groups, one or two sets of documentation, identifying the types of stand-alone content modules or “topics” in each set and examining how each topic is structured. Students might answer questions such as follows: 

* What types of content are included the documentation set (e.g., conceptual information, task-based information, process information, principle-focused information, reference information)?
* How is the collection of content modules or “topics” organized? Given your understanding of audiences who use the documentation and different use cases (reasons for using the documentation), why do you think the topics are organized the way that they are? What are some affordances of this organizational strategy? 
* How are particular topic types (e.g., tasks, concepts) structured? What kind of information comes first, second, third, and so on and do topics of similar types (such as tasks) follow a consistent structure? What are some affordances of structuring topics types in this way?

Facilitate a large-group discussion asking students to share their analysis findings and takeaways with the large group. 

Example sets of documentation that students might analyze are as follows (there are, of course, endless sets that could be analyzed): 

* Microsoft Word Help (open Word, and search help topics)
* [Dropbox Help Center](https://help.dropbox.com/) 
* [Canvas Student Guide](https://community.canvaslms.com/t5/Student-Guide/tkb-p/student)  
* [TechSmith Tutorials](https://www.techsmith.com/learn/tutorials/) (browse by product > select a tutorial and scroll down to see video tutorials and companion text-based tutorials)
* [Xerox Support Portal](https://www.support.xerox.com/en-us) (browse by Product Type > select a product > click Documentation > select a manual/guide to review)
  
Students might also browse through the [Sample Content](https://acm-sigdoc-structured.org/3-sample-content.html) posted to the ACM SIGDOC Structured Authoring Committee Resources website. The sample content includes several documentation projects written in DITA; hosted in GitHub, students can view folders of concept topics, tasks topics, reference topics, and more, and they can see different maps for different products that can be used to assemble relevant topics into complete documentation sets.
