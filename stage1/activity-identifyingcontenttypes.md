# Identifying Content Types and Relationships

## Activity Goals

This activity introduces students to the concepts of structured authoring, structured content, and Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA). Students will learn about the concepts through readings and apply their understanding through an information typing exercise. 

A major trend in user documentation is the move to create information deliverables composed of collections of modular topics, or chunks of stand-alone content, that each focus on one thing, such as answering one question (e.g., How do I?) or explaining one concept (e.g., What is X?). In the field of technical communication, topic-based, modular content development is frequently achieved through the use of XML and, particularly, the standard known as the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA).

This activity, then, is ideally paired with the activity [Analyzing Topic-Based Documentation](activity-analyzingdocumentation.md). 

After completing the readings and the two activities, students will develop a strong grasp of the importance of topic-based content development and the DITA content standard (and how it provides a set of rules for structuring topics).

## Activity Description

This information typing activity is adapted from an assignment on teaching structure proposed by Jason Swarts in his chapter, “Writing about Structure in DITA” (in Bridgeford, 2020, *Teaching Content Management in Technical and Professional Communication*). 

It is ideally assigned after students have completed readings and an activity or assignment that introduces them to the concepts of “mapping,” “typing,” and “topics” and after they have completed readings on structured authoring and DITA. See [Analyzing Topic-Based Documentation](activity-analyzingdocumentation.md). 

The activity asks students to apply their understanding of information typing and the DITA topic types to several unstructured documents (those not composed of structured, content modules or “topics”). Students review the documents and identify types of information included and relationships between pieces of information. The activity can be expanded to include a plan for rewriting and reorganizing one or more documents into a collection of topics.  

Suggested Example Documents to Examine (feel free to choose different documents)

* Recipe – [Crispy Vegan Tofu Schnitzel](https://healthfulblondie.com/wprm_print/39547)
* Installation Guide – Kohler Lighting Fixture
* Installation Guide – Kohler Kitchen Faucet
* Conference Proceeding – ”What Content Strategists Do and Earn”
* A page from a department or campus center website, such as one focused on an internship program, a study abroad program, or writing center services (ideally the page would include different types of information). 

Instructors might begin the activity by facilitating a large-group discussion of an example document. The Kohler kitchen faucet installation guide is a good one to ask students to examine for a few minutes with these questions in mind: What types of information can you identify? Could these information types be classified as concept, task, and reference topics? Which ones? After discussing the guide as a large group, instructors might show students the [Kohler website](www.kohler.com) and identify where the installation guide (and other guides) exist. 

After this large-group discussion, instructors can assign the information typing activity. 

## Task

Ask students to examine two or three unstructured documents and do the following:

* Identify common information types appearing in the document – mark and label them (give them descriptive names).

* Determine the relationship between pieces of information (e.g., dependencies, order). Are parent/child relationships evident? For example, does an information unit that is clearly a task (procedure) include conceptual information, steps, examples, or other elements?

* Determine the rules by which the information types are ordered. Is there an apparent logic to the rules? Do information types consistently include similar rhetorical moves or elements? 

* Create a plan for how you would rewrite and reorganize the document into a collection of topics. What concept, task, and reference topics might you create?
