# Stage 1: Situating *Our* Type of Content

## Overview  
This stage is about understanding the landscape of the discipline of content and the particular kind of content on which the discipline focuses--structured, technical content. Refer to the section Stage 1 in Chapter 7 of our book for a more detailed explanation of this stage.

## Learning Objectives
Through readings, discussions, and activities, instructors introducing students to the discipline of content and *our* type of content might identify the following learning objectives for students:

* understand the forces driving the need to treat and manage content as structured modules, or computable data, and how organizations are doing this through adoption of structured authoring workflows
* develop a big-picture view of the processes, workflows, and life cycles that shape content activities and roles in organizations and the nature of content itself
* gain familiarity with the concepts of content analysis, information typing, and content modeling
* gain understanding of how content modules can interconnect to serve the needs of different audiences for different purposes and of how user and task analysis informs planning for content types and deliverables
* explore possibilities for typing and structuring content content and for combining content modules and assets in different ways

## Resources
Listed [resources](resources.md) are divided into three categories: Surveys of the Content Discipline, Definitions of Content, Explanations of Structured Authoring. We recommend assigning a few resources that describe the content discipline and define content and following up with a class discussion (perhaps after students have completed a reading response). After sorting out definitions and gaining a good understanding of the what and why of the content discipline, we recommend assigning a few resources that explain structuring authoring and the DITA standard.     

## Activities
The activities included in this stage are introductory and can be completed in word processing apps.
