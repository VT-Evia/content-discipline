# Content Strategy Activities

Whether teaching content strategy as a class or as a curricular unit, we recommend a project-based approach. 

If teaching a content strategy class, instructors might partner with local organizations or campus departments or centers that are interested in undergoing a digital content transformation—that is, building a strategic framework to support structured authoring workflows. Student teams could then work with these organizations, completing the various activities necessary to develop a content strategy plan. In doing so, students would participate in the activities comprising the Analyze quadrant of the content life cycle. 

If partnering with non-profit organizations, instructors might ask students to read “Helping Content Strategy: What Technical Communicators Can Do for Non-Profits” by Guiseppe Getto and Suzan Flanagan (published in *Technical Communication, 69*(1), 2022). The authors offer guidance for helping local organizations improve their content strategy processes.

If teaching a course that includes a curricular unit on content strategy, we recommend tying that unit to a larger documentation project that allows students to work through, on a small scale, the content life cycle and the staged approach to learning about our kind of content. Students might document a product or product suite that has yet to be documented or that has existing, unstructured documentation. The goal should be for students to develop a content strategy for creating and maintaining structured documentation rendered in at least two formats (e.g., pdf, html, e-pub). Students would then implement that strategy as they move to the collect, manage, and maintain quadrants of the content life cycle and to stage 3 of our stages approach to learning about our kind of content. 

We recommend that students work through the following activities in developing a content strategy plan.

* Conducting audience and stakeholder analyses
* Conducting a content audit
* Conducting a gap analysis
* Creating a content model ???
* Developing a content strategy plan

#### Conducting Audience and Stakeholder Analyses

Although audience analysis and stakeholder analysis are two different activities, we include them together because they require identifying actual people who either interact with content as users or interact with content as business stakeholders. 

To understand user and business needs as well as content needs, content strategists need to interview content users and business stakeholders. 

Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz offer an excellent how-to chapter on conducting audience analysis in their book *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide*. We recommend assigning students this chapter and asking them to follow the guidance on how to identify and analyze audiences. 

* “Audience Analysis” (Chapter 3) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 35-56.

In their chapter, the authors offer guidance on identifying both external (users) and internal (business stakeholder) audiences. They also offer sample questions to ask of both groups as well as advice on tasks to complete before, during, and after interviews. In addition to — or perhaps in lieu of — conducting individual interviews, students might conduct group interviews, or focus groups. Importantly, in the chapter "Audience Analysis," instructors and students will find an example audience analysis spreadsheet and guidance on how to create personas based on audience analysis findings. 

Rahel Bailie (2019) also offers guidance on the kinds of questions to ask when interviewing business stakeholders. She suggests creating questions that grow out of five business drivers for content (p. 123):

* Extend business reach
* Reduce time to market
* Manage risk
* Retain brand trust
* Increase operational efficiency

Analyzing stakeholders who interact with content — and who oversee product development or control budgets and resources — is of critical importance. “By interviewing a solid cross-section of stakeholders across the organization,” suggest O’Keefe, Pringle, and Swallow, “the content strategist can identify and prioritize the drivers for change, requirements, and success metrics for the content strategy” (p. 130). 

* "Bringing Clarity to Content Strategy" in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Rahel Bailie, pp. 121-124.
* "Understanding Content Strategy as a Specialized Form of Management Consulting " in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Sarah O'Keefe, Alan Pringle, and Bill Swallow, pp. 127-136.

Meghan Casey also offers useful advice for gaining buy-in from stakeholders in her chapter, "Get Stakeholders On Board" (Chapter 3). She describes different stakeholder roles and types and offers an example matrix that students can use to list stakeholders that should be have input in the development of a content strategy. She then reviews different methods for involving stakeholders, from interviews to workshops, anad offers a template for creating a stakeholder communications plan. In the chapter, "Understand Your Business Environment," Casey also shares guidance for conducting stakeholder interviews. We recommend assigning students the "Get Stakeholders On Board" chapter and asking them to follow the guidance on how to identify and involve stakeholders. 

Further, we recommend assigning students the chapters "Understand Your Business Environment" (Chapter 6) and "Learn about Your Audience and Users" (Chapter 7). Here, Casey reviews strategies for understanding the business environment, including conducting interviews and reviewing existing documentation, and for learning about audiences and users. 

* "Get Stakeholders On Board" (Chapter 3) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 22-38.
* "Understand Your Business Environment" (Chapter 6) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 73-86.
* "Learn about Your Audience and Users" (Chapter 7) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 87-100.
