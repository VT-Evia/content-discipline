# Content Strategy Activities

Whether teaching content strategy as a class or as a curricular unit, we recommend a project-based approach. 

If teaching a content strategy class, instructors might partner with local organizations or campus departments or centers that are interested in undergoing a digital content transformation—that is, building a strategic framework to support structured authoring workflows. Student teams could then work with these organizations, completing the various activities necessary to develop a content strategy plan. In doing so, students would participate in the activities comprising the Analyze quadrant of the content life cycle. 

If partnering with non-profit organizations, instructors might ask students to read “Helping Content Strategy: What Technical Communicators Can Do for Non-Profits” by Guiseppe Getto and Suzan Flanagan (published in *Technical Communication, 69*(1), 2022). The authors offer guidance for helping local organizations improve their content strategy processes.

If teaching a course that includes a curricular unit on content strategy, we recommend tying that unit to a larger documentation project that allows students to work through, on a small scale, the content life cycle and the staged approach to learning about our kind of content. Students might document a product or product suite that has yet to be documented or that has existing, unstructured documentation. The goal should be for students to develop a content strategy for creating and maintaining structured documentation rendered in at least two formats (e.g., pdf, html, e-pub). Students would then implement that strategy as they move to the collect, manage, and maintain quadrants of the content life cycle and to stage 3 of our stages approach to learning about our kind of content. 

We recommend that students work through the following activities in developing a content strategy plan.

* Conducting audience and stakeholder analyses
* Conducting a content audit
* Conducting a gap analysis
* Creating a content model ???
* Developing a content strategy plan

#### Conducting Audience and Stakeholder Analyses

Although audience analysis and stakeholder analysis are two different activities, we include them together because they require identifying actual people who either interact with content as users or interact with content as business stakeholders. 

To understand user and business needs as well as content needs, content strategists need to interview content users and business stakeholders. 

Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz offer an excellent how-to chapter on conducting audience analysis in their book *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide*. We recommend assigning students this chapter and asking them to follow the guidance on how to identify and analyze audiences. 

* “Audience Analysis” (Chapter 3) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 35-56.

In their chapter, the authors offer guidance on identifying both external (users) and internal (business stakeholder) audiences. They also offer sample questions to ask of both groups as well as advice on tasks to complete before, during, and after interviews. In addition to — or perhaps in lieu of — conducting individual interviews, students might conduct group interviews, or focus groups. Importantly, in the chapter "Audience Analysis," instructors and students will find an example audience analysis spreadsheet and guidance on how to create personas based on audience analysis findings. 

Rahel Bailie (2019) also offers guidance on the kinds of questions to ask when interviewing business stakeholders. She suggests creating questions that grow out of five business drivers for content (p. 123):

* Extend business reach
* Reduce time to market
* Manage risk
* Retain brand trust
* Increase operational efficiency

Analyzing stakeholders who interact with content — and who oversee product development or control budgets and resources — is of critical importance. “By interviewing a solid cross-section of stakeholders across the organization,” suggest O’Keefe, Pringle, and Swallow, “the content strategist can identify and prioritize the drivers for change, requirements, and success metrics for the content strategy” (p. 130). 

* "Bringing Clarity to Content Strategy" in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Rahel Bailie, pp. 121-124.
* "Understanding Content Strategy as a Specialized Form of Management Consulting " in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Sarah O'Keefe, Alan Pringle, and Bill Swallow, pp. 127-136.

Meghan Casey also offers useful advice for gaining buy-in from stakeholders in her chapter, "Get Stakeholders On Board" (Chapter 3). She describes different stakeholder roles and types and offers an example matrix that students can use to list stakeholders that should be have input in the development of a content strategy. She then reviews different methods for involving stakeholders, from interviews to workshops, anad offers a template for creating a stakeholder communications plan. In the chapter, "Understand Your Business Environment," Casey also shares guidance for conducting stakeholder interviews. We recommend assigning students the "Get Stakeholders On Board" chapter and asking them to follow the guidance on how to identify and involve stakeholders. 

Further, we recommend assigning students the chapters "Understand Your Business Environment" (Chapter 6) and "Learn about Your Audience and Users" (Chapter 7). Here, Casey reviews strategies for understanding the business environment, including conducting interviews and reviewing existing documentation, and for learning about audiences and users. 

* "Get Stakeholders On Board" (Chapter 3) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 22-38.
* "Understand Your Business Environment" (Chapter 6) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 73-86.
* "Learn about Your Audience and Users" (Chapter 7) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit" by Meghan Casey, pp. 87-100.

#### Conducting a Content Audit

The next activity in developing a content strategy is to conduct a content audit, which is the process of taking inventory of all existing content and then assessing the quality of that content. 

The goals and scope of a content audit vary and are largely defined by the business and stakeholder needs identified in the previous stage of developing a content strategy. Metrics for measuring quality will also vary, but multiple resources offer excellent suggestions for metrics that can be tailored for most projects: 

* “A Hierarchy of Content Needs” (2014) by Sarah O’Keefe, from https://www.scriptorium.com/2014/03/a-hierarchy-of-content-needs/

* “Performing a Content Audit” (Chapter 10) in *Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy* (2012) by Ann Rockley and Alan Cooper, pp. 101-118.

*”Developing a Rubric” and “Assessing Content” (sections in Chapter 5) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 83-93.

In addition to taking inventory of content and assessing content quality, a key goal of the content audit is to identify, as suggested by Rockley and Cooper (2012), the following: who needs and uses particular content, how well existing content meets user needs, and what processes are in place for creating, managing, and delivering content (p. 10). 

If you are teaching a class on content strategy and partnering with local organizations or campus departments or centers, student projects might focus on auditing website content alone or on an array of content types distributed across different delivery channels. 

For content strategy projects focused on website content, we recommend the content audit guidance offered by Meghan Casey (2023) in her chapters 1 and 8: 

* "Identify Problems and Opportunities" (Chapter 1) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit* (2023) by Meghan Casey, pp. 5-16.
* "Get Familiar with Your Content" (Chapter 8) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit* (2023) by Meghan Casey, pp. 101-118.

In chapter 1, Casey also offers two tools for conducting a content audit that students will likely find useful: (1) Content Strategy Tool 1.1: Audit Planning Tips and Templates and (2) Content Strategy Tool 1.2: A Super Simple User Test.

For projects focused on developing a content strategy that defines a strategic framework for supporting structured authoring workflows (that is, for moving from unstructured to structured content)—likely for projects focused on documentation, but marketing and training content may also be included—, we recommend the content audit guidance offered by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and Sheryl Ruszkiewicz (2023) and by Ann Rockley and Alan Cooper (2012).

* “Identifying Content Types and Channels” (Chapter 4) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 57-70.
* "Content Auditing” (Chapter 5) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 71-103.
*“Performing a Content Audit” (Chapter 10) in *Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy* (2012) by Ann Rockley and Alan Cooper, pp. 101-118.

In addition to reviewing the purpose of a content audit and parts of an audit, Getto, Labriola, and Ruszkiewics offer excellent guidance on how to approach a content inventory, and they include a free downloadable template for documenting content sources, types, channels, and publication dates and rating content based on defined assessment criteria. They provide advice, as well, on defining assessment criteria and creating findings from an audit. 

For more specific guidance on conducting a content audit for an organization that wants to adopt structured authoring workflows (or, in the case of small class projects, that wants to document a product using a structured authoring approach), we recommend assigning the chapter “Performing a Content Audit” by Ann Rockley and Alan Cooper. 

The authors talk specifically about strategies for assessing opportunities for content reuse and for analyzing existing content for reuse. When conducting an audit, they write, “[y]ou look for similar and identical information, as well as for information that could be similar or identical, but is currently distinct. One you see how your information is being used and reused, you can make decisions about how you might unify it” (p. 101). Students will also find helpful example tables that they can adopt for conducting both a top-level analysis and an in-depth analysis of information products and other materials.

#### Conducting a Gap Analysis

A gap analysis, suggests Sarah O’Keefe, Alan Pringle, and Bill Swallow, assesses the distance between the current quality of the content and the desired quality of the content” (p. 131). It further assesses gaps in needed roles and associated responsibilities, processes, and tools. 

Students conducting a gap analysis should draw on results of their audience and stakeholder analysis and content audit to determine needs for content, roles, processes, and tools. 

The results of a content strategy gap analysis may include the following:

* Roles and responsibilities
* Content quality gaps
* Content architecture and storage format
* Content management
* Content governance gaps
* Content delivery gaps

Refer to the section “Content Strategy Gap Analysis” for a detailed breakdown of what to examine in this activity. 

* ”Content Strategy Gap Analysis” (section in the article, "Understanding Content Strategy as a Specialized Form of Management Consulting") in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Sarah O'Keefe, Alan Pringle, and Bill Swallow, pp. 131-132

Notably, some experts, such as Getto, Labriola, and Ruszkiewicz (2023), include the gap analysis as part of the content audit – the final activity necessary for writing the content audit report. Either way, this activity is necessary for determining the plan of action that will become the content strategy.

Students developing a content strategy for an organization may find Meghan Casey’s guidance on evaluating processes helpful. Casey offers guidance on identifying areas of opportunity for improvement, focusing specifically on people, processes, governance, and collaboration.

* "Evaluate Your Processes" (Chapter 9) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit* by Meghan Casey, pp. 119-131.

Students developing a content strategy for particular documentation projects, given their small scope compared to developing a strategy for an organization, will likely focus their gap analysis on user and stakeholder needs and content needs. Ideally, they would also attend to processes and governance.

We also recommend assigning Rahel Bailie’s article, “Bringing Clarity to Content Strategy." A key question guiding a gap analysis, suggests Bailie, is “What are the operational needs”? She asks, “What systems are in place to facilitate the production, management, delivery, and governance of content” Whatever system is being used, does it help or hinder professionals who produce the content? Does the organization understand enough about content technologies to be able to even recognize what they need?” (p. 124).  

Another key question for a gap analysis includes “What are the technology needs?” Bailie asks, “What technologies are in place, and what new technologies are needed to support the efforts described?” (p. 124). 

* "Bringing Clarity to Content Strategy" in *Technical Communication* (2019), 66(2), by Rahel Bailie, pp. 121-124.

#### Creating a Content Model

The next activity in developing a content strategy is content modeling, “the process of creating structures and frameworks that content must adhere to” (Getto, Labriola, & Ruszkiewicz, 2023, p. 104). Content modeling is an important step in defining the structure of different content types (e.g., tasks, definitions, concepts, troubleshooting information); for technical content, this process usually requires following structures pre-defined in a content standard such as DITA. Content modeling ensures that content of the same type follows a consistent structure and includes the same kind of information (or, in DITA, the same required elements). It ensures that content is both reusable and adaptable, and it offers important descriptive information (metadata) about each content type—its purposes, its uses, its audiences, its associated products, and more. 

Students modeling website, blog post, and social media content for an organization will find the guidance offered by Getto, Labriola, and Ruszkiewicz (2023) helpful. Their chapter on “Content Modeling” reviews strategies for modeling blog posts, website content, and social media posts—content that should follow consistent structures but that may not ultimately exist in structured authoring workflows (though website content often includes support and marketing content that can benefit from integration into structured authoring workflows, allowing it to be easily reused and repurposed for different genres and delivery channels). 

We recommend supplementing this guidance with that of Meghan Casey in her chapter, "Specifying Content Structure and Requirements.” Casey offers a robust review of the importance of structuring content to create repeatable content patterns across similar content types (such as a recipe). And she offers a list of the kinds of information that should be included in a content model. Further, she offers helpful examples plus free content modeling tutorials for content professionals (Content Strategy Tool 15.1 and 15.2).

* "Specifying Content Structure and Requirements" (Chapter 15) in *The Content Strategy Toolkit* by Meghan Casey, pp. 235-251.
* "Content Modeling” (Chapter 5) in *Content Strategy: A How-to Guide* (2023) by Guiseppe Getto, Jack Labriola, and S. Ruszkiewicz, pp. 71-103.

Students developing content strategies for documenting a product or suite of products will also find useful guidance in Getto, Labriola, and Ruszkiewicz but this time in the “Article in a Structured Database” section in their chapter “Content Modeling.” The section reviews strategies for modeling content types, or modular information units, that will exist in structured authoring workflows. 

Perhaps most helpful for modeling this type of content—that is, content intended to be modular, format-free, well-structured, and semantically enhanced for the purpose of being human and machine readable—is the guidance offered by Rockley and Cooper in their chapter, “Content modeling: Adaptive content design.” The authors describe this type of content as “format-free, device-independent, scalable, and filterable” and “transformable for display in different environments and on different devices in an automated or dynamic fashion” (p. 134). This is the type of content on which *Technical Communication and the Discipline of Content* focuses. 

In their chapter, Rockley and Cooper emphasize the importance of two types of modeling: (1) modeling an information product and (2) modeling the individual information units—or modules—comprising that product. They offer examples of both types of content models, which should help students understand how they might create their own models. 

* “Content Modeling: Adaptive Content Design” (Chapter 12) in *Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy* (2012) by Ann Rockley and Alan Cooper, pp. 133-150. 

The audience for content models is often the information technologists or content engineers who oversee the technical implementation of the content strategy plan and requirements as defined in content models. But for class projects that ask students to engage with the staged approach to structured authoring described in *Technical Communication and the Discipline of Content,” students will need to implement their own content models and content strategy plans (that is, unless they are working with an organization that has asked them to create a content strategy plan and no more). 

Students in most cases will need to be their own content engineers, using their content models as guidelines for authoring consistent content, reusing that content where appropriate, and adding metadata to content to assist users, authors, and machines with search and retrieval. Thus, in addition to assigning chapter 12 in Rockley and Cooper, we recommend assigning chapter 13, “Reuse strategy,” and chapter 15, “Designing metadata.” Identifying reuse and metadata needs for information units in a content model can be immensely helpful in the implementation of a content strategy.
